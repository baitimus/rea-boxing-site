# Logo Image

## Required Logo
Place your logo image here:
- **Filename**: `logo.png` (or `logo.svg` for vector)
- **Recommended specs**:
  - Format: PNG with transparency or SVG
  - Size: Square ratio recommended (e.g., 500x500px)
  - Background: Transparent
  - Style: Should work well on video backgrounds
  - Color: Ensure good visibility against various backgrounds

## Display Context
- The logo will be displayed inside a 400px white circular outline
- It has padding of 3rem inside the circle
- A drop shadow is applied for depth
- The logo scales responsively down to 280px circles on mobile

## Notes
- SVG format preferred for crisp scaling
- PNG should be high resolution (at least 1000px)
- Ensure the logo has enough contrast to be visible over video
